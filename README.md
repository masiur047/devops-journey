## ðŸ“Œ Day 1: Introduction to DevOps

### ðŸ”¹ What is DevOps?
DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural mindset that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).  
It focuses on collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery to deliver high-quality software faster.

### ðŸ”¹ Why DevOps is Needed
- Breaks the silos between developers and operations.
- Reduces manual deployment errors.
- Speeds up release cycles.
- Provides faster feedback and more reliable systems.

### ðŸ”¹ Benefits of DevOps
- **Speed:** Faster feature delivery.
- **Quality:** Automated testing reduces bugs.
- **Reliability:** Continuous monitoring improves stability.
- **Collaboration:** Better teamwork between Dev and Ops.
- **Scalability:** Infrastructure as Code makes scaling easier.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts
- **Collaboration** â€“ Dev + Ops working together.
- **Automation** â€“ Automating builds, tests, deployments, and infrastructure.
- **CI/CD** â€“ Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery for faster releases.
- **IaC** â€“ Infrastructure managed as code (e.g., Terraform, Ansible).
- **Monitoring** â€“ Tracking system health (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).

## ðŸ“Œ Day 4: Linux Basics

### ðŸ”¹ Linux File System
- Linux uses a hierarchical directory structure:
  - `/` â†’ root directory  
  - `/home` â†’ user directories  
  - `/etc` â†’ configuration files  
  - `/var` â†’ logs and temporary files  
  - `/bin`, `/usr/bin` â†’ essential binaries  

- Basic commands:
```bash
pwd        # show current directory
ls         # list files
cd /etc    # change directory
mkdir test # create folder
rmdir test # remove empty folder

ðŸ”¹ File Permissions

Every file has owner, group, others with read (r), write (w), execute (x) permissions.

Example:

ls -l
-rwxr-xr--  1 mashu devops  123 Sep 9  script.sh


Change permissions:

chmod 755 script.sh
chmod +x script.sh
chown user:group file

ðŸ”¹ Processes

Processes = running programs

Commands:

ps aux        # list processes
top           # show active processes
kill <PID>    # kill process by ID

ðŸ”¹ Hands-On Practice (Docker Ubuntu)

Run Ubuntu container:

docker run -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash


Inside container:

ls /
cd /home
mkdir devops-test
echo "Hello DevOps" > hello.txt
cat hello.txt
chmod +x hello.txt
ps aux


Exit container: exit

Start stopped container again:

docker ps -a
docker start -ai <container_name_or_id>
